# Expedition-Planner
### Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JS

Expedition Planner is an interactive application based on the concept of graphs. The graph algorithm which is being used here to find the shortest path is Dijktra's Algorithm. Dijkstra's Algorithm is based on the principle of relaxation, in which more accurate values gradually replace an approximation to the correct distance until the shortest distance is reached. 

The algorithm works in the following way: -
